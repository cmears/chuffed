Compile using:

cmake:
This will compile chuffed and create a library in an external directory
that you can then use within other software. 
First, create a directory "build" in trunk/, and enter that directory
to call cmake with a prefix that sets the installation directory (this
directory does not have to exist already). Enter the following commands 
in your shell in the current directory to do all that:
cd ..
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/path/to/chuffed-install ..
make 
make install

make:
This will compile the solver, but not create a library. Simply
evoke make in the current directory.

Flatzinc solver is invoked using:

fzn_chuffed file.fzn
